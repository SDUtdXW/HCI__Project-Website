# Hint

**In this project, we collected Survey results of 10 potential users and Interview results of 4 potential users. In addition, we classified and sorted the collected results and exported them into a table of type xlsx. The Survey results were placed in Survey_Raw_Data.xlsx and the Interview results were sorted in Interview_Raw_Data.xlsx. The Survey objective of this project is random and extensive, which to some extent can well reflect the impact of AI on People's Daily life. However, due to the numerous questions designed, few people are willing to complete our interviews and surveys, and the obtained sample number is limited, which makes the results full of chance, which we are overcoming!**
