## Background
>In this project, the team designed survey questionnaires and interview scripts focusing on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in various domains, including education, employment, entertainment, and healthcare. Respondents from multiple positions and age groups, such as students, teachers, and company employees, were selected. A total of 10 surveys and 4 interviews were conducted. Through this research, we gained a preliminary understanding of people's experiences and thoughts regarding AI technology. This holds significant reference value for exploring the future development of AI.
